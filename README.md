# CSGO-Case-Calculator
### Little program to calculate the value off your CS:GO weapon cases you have.

1. Enter the amount of Cases you have per case
2. Click on the check boxes of the cases you have
3. Click on reload prices to get the prices of the cases you have checked
4. When all prices are loaded click on calculate
5. Before closing the program or when you have entered all amounts click on save cases to save the amounts

Amounts and checked boxes will be load on startup

**If you want to calculate the prices automatically when loading them, check the "Calculate automatic" check box**

Q: Why is there a pause between when loading the price of every case?  
A: When you request the prices too often Steam thinks you try to DDoS the API (witch I'm using to get the prices) and your pc is banned for about an hour from using accesing the API. Don't panic, the ban would NOT effect your account from using Steam normally.
(If someone knows a good alternative to reduce/ remove the wait time, please be so kind give me the tip)
